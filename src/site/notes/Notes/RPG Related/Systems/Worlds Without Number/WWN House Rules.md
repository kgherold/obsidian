## General 

### Bonds - [[Journal/2025-04-15\|2025-04-15]]
- Bonds: describes your relationship with another PC.
	- Each person has 1 bond per PC, and a PC can have a different bond with you than you have with them.
	- A bond becomes charged when you exemplify the bond via RP or if it puts you in danger
	- Bonds can also be charged by picking a PC when camping and choosing something to RP about. Both PCs bonds are charged when this happens. -
	- Bonds are spent during recovery phase of camping to do multiples of the following: Heal HP (25% of max), remove 1 fatigue, clear a condition, or gain a luck die. Fatigue must be removed before the other options are selected. 

### Camp Phase [[Journal/2025-04-15\|2025-04-15]]

2. Break bread 
3. Check for a random encounter

	- Fellowship 
		- Pick another PC or NPC and engage in a role-play with them 
		- Share a memory. Talk about their quests. Ask about their childhood; tell about yours.
		- End the conversation meaningfully so that the table knows you're done talking.
		- At the end of this exchange, you both charge your Bonds with each other. 
	- Scout ahead 
		- Walk quietly outside of camp, peer down hallways, and listen at adjacent doors. If you scout around, you might be able to learn something interesting about the terrain. Test wis/survive 
	- Patrol 
		- If an interruption occurs, can draw from the bag twice and pick the desired result 
	- Identify a magical item  
	- Read a book 
		- Read a book that you’re carrying with you. Ask the GM one question related to the subject matter of the book. They will tell you what the book says about it.

### Followers [[Journal/2024-08-20\|2024-08-20]]
- See [[Notes/RPG Related/Systems/Worlds Without Number/WWN NPC Follower Rules\|WWN NPC Follower Rules]]

- Followers can hold up to 3 items  (fit without overlap on the back of their index card, not including equipment), large followers can carry 3 items of any ENC up to 6

#### Bond Level 
- Can give your XP to your follower  to increase their bond level (slow leveling)

### Group Actions [[Journal/2025-02-13\|2025-02-13]]
- Everyone who is doing the activity rolls and if half are successful (rounding up) 

### Helping  [[Journal/2024-08-20\|2024-08-20]]
- The helper(s) rolls the same check and if they are successful they add +1 to your result, if they are unsuccessful they add -1 to your roll 
- In either case the helper is subject to any negative results of the check
### Luck Dice -  [[Journal/2024-08-17\|2024-08-17]] 
- Dice cannot be added after a roll is completed
- You can roll as many dice as you have. 
### Magic - updated [[Journal/2024-08-08\|2024-08-08]] - Thursday
- 1d20 Int/Magic
- DC10 + level of the spell 
- Coruscating Coffin and Howl of light deal damage equal to the level of the spell cast 
	- 10d8 is the max damage and requires a DC20 check. 
- Success = spell is cast 
- Failure = spell is forgotten until rest 
- 1 = roll on the special tables - [[Notes/RPG Related/Systems/Shadowdark/Shadowdark Spell Mishaps\|Shadowdark Spell Mishaps]]. A 1 cannot be provided
#### Torching 
- [[Journal/2025-01-07\|2025-01-07]] - Can cast any spell, even one forgotten  without a roll but for each level of the spell they cast, roll 1d6; 1=Strength, 2=Intelligence, and so forth down the line. That attribute takes a temporary -1 score penalty. Thus, if they torch a 5th level spell, they randomly lose 5 attribute points temporarily. Gain 1 point of ability score back each time they burn a bond to restore HP

#### Spellburn 
- The spellcaster temporarily expends points of their Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score to enhance their spell check. 
- For every ability point they expend, the wizard adds +1 to their spell check.
- Each day they do not attempt spellburn, they recover 1 point of ability score. 
- Automatic criticals: A spellcaster who sacrifices a full 20 points of ability scores in one fell swoop automatically treats their next spell check as a roll of natural 20.
